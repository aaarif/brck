## Testing the application
* Before using the application, We need to create a customer account from the interface. Copy this url `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/` to a browser. 
* Enter Customer name then click Submit button. We want to get customer id from the newly created customer
* To get the customer ID we need to login to Djago Admin interface. We need to create user admin. In the cmd prompt or terminal, use command `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create user admin. Choose user and password that's easy to remember eg. `admin` for user, `admin123` for password
* Open this url `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` in a browser, you will see admin interface of the app. Input username and password that you created before
* In the Site Administration, under MyApp appears object Customers that contain the information of a customer that you created, copy the uid somewhere. We want to start using it to test
